# Client-Only Features - Navbar Update

## 🎯 **Objective**
Restrict support and notification features to clients only, hiding them from admins and employees.

## ✅ **Changes Made**

### 1. **Notifications Button** 🔔
- **✅ Client Only**: Added role check `{currentUser && currentUser.role === 'client' && (...)}`
- **✅ Hidden from Admin/Employee**: Notifications bell only appears for clients
- **✅ Conditional Rendering**: Button only renders when user role is 'client'

### 2. **Help & Support Button** ❓
- **✅ Client Only**: Already had role check, now consistent with notifications
- **✅ Support Modal**: Only accessible to clients
- **✅ Help Features**: Quick actions and contact info only for clients

### 3. **Visual Divider** ➖
- **✅ Conditional Display**: Divider only shows when there are buttons before it
- **✅ Clean Layout**: No unnecessary dividers for admin/employee views
- **✅ Consistent Spacing**: Maintains proper spacing regardless of role

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Before (All Users)**
```jsx
{/* Notifications - Visible to all */}
<button onClick={() => setShowNotificationsModal(true)}>
  <FaBell />
</button>

{/* Help - Only clients */}
{currentUser && currentUser.role === 'client' && (
  <button onClick={() => setShowHelpModal(true)}>
    <FaQuestionCircle />
  </button>
)}
```

### **After (Client Only)**
```jsx
{/* Notifications - Only clients */}
{currentUser && currentUser.role === 'client' && (
  <button onClick={() => setShowNotificationsModal(true)}>
    <FaBell />
  </button>
)}

{/* Help - Only clients */}
{currentUser && currentUser.role === 'client' && (
  <button onClick={() => setShowHelpModal(true)}>
    <FaQuestionCircle />
  </button>
)}
```
