## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Backend Route Fix**
```javascript

// After: Clients can create tickets
router.post("/", authMiddleware, authorize("client"), createTicket);
```

### **New Ticket Service Functions**
```javascript
// Get assigned tickets for employees
export const getAssignedTickets = async (page = 1, limit = 10, status = 'all') => {
  const response = await api.get(`/tickets/my?${params.toString()}`);
  return response.data;
};

// Resolve ticket (employee action)
export const resolveTicket = async (ticketId) => {
  const response = await api.patch(`/tickets/${ticketId}/status`, {
    status: 'resolved'
  });
  return response.data;
};
```

### **SweetAlert Integration**
```javascript
// Professional confirmation dialog
const result = await Swal.fire({
  title: 'Resolve Ticket?',
  text: `Mark ticket "${ticket?.title}" as resolved?`,
  icon: 'question',
  showCancelButton: true,
  confirmButtonColor: '#242021',
  confirmButtonText: 'Yes, resolve it!',
  customClass: {
    confirmButton: 'bg-[#242021] hover:bg-[#3a3537] text-[#ffd17a] px-6 py-2 rounded-lg font-medium transition-colors'
  }
});
```
